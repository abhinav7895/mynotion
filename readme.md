# My Awesome Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built with the amazing Next.js Notion Starter Kit! I'd like to give a huge shoutout to the creator, Travis Fischer, for providing such a fantastic base to work with. 

**Check out the original repo here:** [https://transitivebullsh.it/nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://transitivebullsh.it/nextjs-notion-starter-kit)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo:**

   ```

2. **Customize Your Config**
  - Open the `site.config.ts` file.
  - Edit the `rootNotionPageId` with the ID of your public Notion page. Instructions on how to find this ID are within the original repo's README.
  - Optionally, fill in your `Notion Workspace ID` (if you have one) for additional features. 

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
